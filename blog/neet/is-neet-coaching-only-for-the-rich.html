    <h1>Is NEET Coaching Only for the Rich?</h1>

    <p><strong>A dream is a dream.</strong><br>
    It feels the same for everyone.</p>

    <p>
      The fire burning inside a dream doesn’t know whether you can afford fees
      or manage a financial crisis. That dream might have started in childhood—
      playing with a toy stethoscope. Or from the fascination with a white coat.
      Or from a seed planted by parents long ago.
    </p>

    <p><strong>But where are many of those dreamers now?</strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Some convinced themselves that the syllabus was too vast.</li>
      <li>Some were convinced by parents who simply couldn’t afford it.</li>
      <li>Some dreams slowly faded.</li>
      <li>Some were buried completely.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>But why?</strong></p>

    <p>
      Because of the fear of failure.
    </p>

    <p>
      Failing after spending a huge amount of money.<br>
      Failing even after writing countless mock tests.<br>
      Failing despite joining a so-called “top” institute with AIR results.
    </p>

    <p>
      That fear breaks dreams more than the exam itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>NEET is not for the rich.</strong><br>
      It is for those with perseverance, consistency, and the courage to keep going.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yes, words like hard work and perseverance sound common and boring now.
      But for uncommon dreams like becoming a doctor, you still need those very
      common qualities—used every single day.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ve already done the hardest part.<br>
      <strong>You dreamed.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Dreaming itself is an art.<br>
      You’ve already created your masterpiece in your heart and mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don’t ruin your own art because of fear, money, or others’ opinions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This galaxy is your art gallery.<br>
      And I hope every dream finds its place on display.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>NEET is not for the rich.</strong><br>
      It’s not for the privileged.
    </p>

    <p><strong>It’s for you.</strong></p>
